When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
If the work is to be shared with other users/developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If the remote repository is being shared, you would want them at a good
stopping point where a branch could be created.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Clone is a complete copy of a repository.  Cannot see the origin.  Fork is done
on GitHub, you can see the original.  Branch is addition to repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
Convenience.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
Have one central repo and collaberate verbally

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
