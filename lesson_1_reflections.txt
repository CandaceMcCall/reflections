How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I now understand what -u in the option.  Already familiar with diff

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Can see mistakes or previous thinking

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
Best to do at logical changes so if you rollback your commits, everything still
works.

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
When making a logical change, it can involve more than one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Do see what changed.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
Because you can always revert back and also see what you did wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
